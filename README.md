# Useful Scripts

Useful [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) scripts for use on OS X with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh). Most of these are simply wrappers around other utilities with the appropriate options set for my use-case.

## Scripts

* [beer.sh](beer.sh) - Update [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and optionally cleanup
* [carbon-copy.sh](carbon-copy.sh) - Create a backup of a disk
* [img-anonymise.sh](img-anonymise.sh) - Remove personally identifiable information from images

## Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:robhardwick/scripts.git ~/Documents/scripts
echo 'export PATH="~/Documents/scripts:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```
